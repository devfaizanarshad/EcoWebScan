# EcoWebScan

EcoWebScan is a web application designed to measure and analyze the environmental impact of any website. It provides a detailed report on carbon emissions, page weight, and hosting practices, along with actionable recommendations to promote a more sustainable digital presence.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Carbon Footprint Analysis**: Calculates the estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions per page visit.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Measures total page weight and data transferred.
-   **Green Hosting Detection**: Checks if the website is hosted by a provider using renewable energy.
-   **Grading System**: Provides an intuitive A+ to F rating for carbon efficiency, page weight, and overall performance.
-   **Environmental Impact Equivalents**: Translates digital data into tangible metrics like trees needed, car miles driven, and smartphone charges.
-   **Yearly Impact Projections**: Estimates the annual carbon footprint based on monthly visitor traffic.
-   **Actionable Recommendations**: Offers prioritized suggestions for reducing a site's environmental impact, covering images, code, hosting, and design.
-   **Potential Savings**: Estimates the potential reduction in CO‚ÇÇ emissions if optimizations are applied.

## üöÄ How It Works

EcoWebScan provides a simple interface for users to analyze a website's sustainability:

1.  The user enters a website URL into the input field.
2.  The frontend sends a request to the backend API (`/api/analyze`).
3.  The server uses the `website-carbon-calculator` and `@tgwf/co2` libraries to fetch website data (like bytes transferred via Google PageSpeed Insights) and calculate CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
4.  The backend processes this information to generate ratings, environmental impact comparisons, and tailored recommendations.
5.  The comprehensive analysis is sent back to the frontend and displayed on a clean and responsive results dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
-   **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **Core Libraries**:
    -   `website-carbon-calculator`: For calculating web carbon metrics.
    -   `@tgwf/co2`: The Green Web Foundation's library for CO‚ÇÇ estimation.
-   **Security & Validation**:
    -   `helmet`: Secures the application by setting various HTTP headers.
    -   `express-rate-limit`: Provides rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
    -   `express-validator`: For validating incoming API requests.
-   **Deployment**: Vercel

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

The application exposes the following REST API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                                                      |
| :----- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/analyze`   | Analyzes a given URL and returns the full sustainability report. |
| `GET`  | `/api/tips`      | Returns a list of general optimization tips for web sustainability. |
| `GET`  | `/api/health`    | A health check endpoint to confirm the service is running.       |

### Example: `/api/analyze`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "url": "http://example.com",
    "ratings": {
      "carbon": "A+",
      "weight": "A+",
      "overall": "A",
      "isGreenHost": false
    },
    "statistics": {
      "co2": "0.00281",
      "pageWeight": "12.34",
      "greenHost": false,
      "dataTransfer": 12638
    },
    "environmentalImpact": {
      "treesNeeded": "0.00",
      "carMiles": "0.01",
      "smartphoneCharges": "1",
      "equivalentPhotos": "2",
      "equivalentSongs": "0.00"
    },
    // ... and more data
  }
}
```

## üîß Local Development Setup

To run EcoWebScan on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devfaizanarshad/EcoWebScan.git
    cd EcoWebScan
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google PageSpeed API key:
    ```
    CARBON_API_KEY=your_google_pagespeed_api_key
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
